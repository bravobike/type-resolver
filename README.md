Type resolver is a library to resolve spec-types at compile time.
That is, reducing the specs to only native types by resolving user-defined,
built-in and remote types. The result is a type expressed in easy to
handle structs representing types.

## Rationale

Often we want to analyze spec-types in macros and derive functionality
from these types. Analyzing and working with AST from `Code.Typespec` or
Erlang AST is challenging and cumbersome. Furthermore, there is no
standalone library that resolves user-defined types, built-in types and
remote-types. This library fills this gap.

## Usage

The library offers the macro `TypeResolver.resolve/1`, that can be used
as follows:

```elixir
TypeResolver.resolve(integer() | String.t())
```

It returns the following representation:


```elixir
%TypeResolver.UnionT{
  inner: [%TypeResolver.Types.IntegerT{}, %TypeResolver.Types.BinaryT{}]
}
```

## Type exporter

To resolve remote types, we rely on `Code.Typespec.fetch_types/1`. For
this function to work, the module has to be compiled into a beam file,
which cannot always be ensured at macro expansion time.

To handle this problem, we provide the module `TypeResolver.TypeExporter`.
This module takes care of types being exported and makes them available
at macro expansion time. The module has to be used in the remote module
that contains the type, as follows: 

```elixir
defmodule MyRemoteModule do 
  use TypeResolver.TypeExporter

  @type my_remote_t :: ...
end
```

## Limitations

- Currently, this library cannot handle recursive types and does not detect
  them. When using recursive times, compilation will be stuck in an infinite
  recursion.
- Struct types don't get their member resolved
